name = input ("What is your name?").strip().title()
#.strip() makes any uneeded spaces work .title() makes all words start with a capital latter, .lower() makes everything lowercase. Thats all you need to know about that for now.
print("Hello there " + name)



#This may seem pointless but it will be used in many different ways.
#You can print any variable like this,
print(name)
#That will print the variable, later you will use this in funtions and importing code.
